Write a program that uses a loop to print the integers 1 to 100, one
number on each line. When a number is divisible by 5, print "Roar" on
the same line, and separate them by a space. When a number is divisible
by 7, print "Lions"; and when a number is divisible by 35, print "Roar
Lions!".

Note that a number divisible by 35 will also be divisible by 5 and 7. In
this case, only "Roar Lions!" should be printed.

commit at least: index.php

Extra Credit: Provide an input form that accepts a number n that
determines how many times the loop should iterate (100 in the example
above). The form should also allow the end-user to enter any two words
to display and concatenate (e.g., "Roar" and "Lions" above).
